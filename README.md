Browse, inspect, edit, and manage Kubernetes clusters without leaving Omniview. The Kubernetes plugin provides real-time resource tables, an integrated terminal, log streaming, port forwarding, Helm chart management, cluster metrics, and full YAML editing — all from a single, unified interface.

Resource icons come from the upstream [Kubernetes Icons Set](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/aeee117fa02e25b68298999d699fb45bdc91acb7/icons), bundled under Apache-2.0. Source attribution and license live in `ui/src/icons/kubernetes/NOTICE` and `LICENSE`. The plugin registers one `ResourceIconSetV1` at `omniview/resource/icons`; both sidebar layouts and the host search palette reuse it. Icons use exact native logical Types, independent of served API version. Unknown resources and custom groups use the host fallback.

Native artwork is adapted to monochrome resource glyphs without blue badges and uses inherited `currentColor` in every theme. Trusted bundled SVG geometry is imported inline, so sidebar and search icons need no image requests or cross-origin asset URLs. Sanitized assets contain no scripts, embedded HTML, external references, or style URLs; regression tests enforce the geometry and attribute allowlists. Modification details remain in `NOTICE`.

## Candidate frontend CI

PRs explicitly labeled `resource-v2-candidate` use `hack/candidate-ui.mjs`, not
the last published runtime. Unlabeled PRs retain the frozen published install.
Repository administrators must set
`OMNIVIEW_RESOURCE_V2_REVIEWED_HOST_REVISION` to an independently approved full
host commit and `OMNIVIEW_RESOURCE_V2_REVIEWED_SDK_REVISION` to the independently
approved SDK commit. The selected host's checked-in `e2e/source-cohort.json`
owns the exact SDK, UI, and Kubernetes commits. Its Kubernetes gitlink and the
actual PR head must match that cohort. Missing approval fails closed.

The helper reuses the approved host's admission checks, unchanged isolation
baseline, real native-pnpm protocol probe, and canonical cohort preparation CLI.
The CLI creates and links an isolated managed workspace and supplies its package
launcher and producer graph. Lint, native typechecking, behavior tests, New York
age-clock tests, and production UI builds run against that selected source
workspace. No package files or `node_modules` exports are patched. PR execution
uses read-only permissions without persisted checkout credentials.

Candidate preparation compiles the real native host cohort tool. Linux therefore
needs the same GTK 4, WebKitGTK 6.0, Wayland, compiler and pkg-config development
prerequisites as the host CI image; the labeled workflow installs them explicitly.
The unlabeled published dependency lane does not run this native setup.

Shared producer preparation and the final production build use the canonical
`build-plugin-ui` operation, which owns dependency order, staged outputs,
publication, and generated shims. Consumer checks use the supplied supervised
package launcher; they do not overwrite producer distributions.
The helper persists the constructed cohort before building producers. An always-run
cleanup step retires that cohort through the host's canonical unlink/remove
transaction, including after producer or check failures. Failed preparation before
cohort construction retains its private failure artifacts without claiming a
stopped process or deleting unrelated data.

This candidate-only validation does not change published dependency manifests,
stable-main installs, or release packaging. After publication, ordinary registry
validation must use the reviewed published cohort and its frozen lockfile.

## Resource v2 boundary

The resource provider uses one `resourcev2` domain and transport. Catalog operations are qualified by an explicit connection, type, and declared scope. Get, bounded enumeration, native queries, create, update, delete, actions, and advisory updates remain independent capabilities. Native label queries declare their language and input schema in the catalog.

Native types use `k8s:<actual-api-group>/<resource>`. The core API group stays empty (`k8s:/pods`), so a custom group named `core` remains distinct (`k8s:core/pods`). Helm uses `helm:releases`, `helm:repositories`, and `helm:charts`; the Polaris audit uses `audit:polaris`. Synthetic types cannot collide with native API groups. Served API versions belong to representation and schema bindings, not logical identity. The catalog retains the UI default and separately declares a managed-field-free model representation. IDs are native object names; namespace is an adapter-declared scope dimension. UID is an optional incarnation, and resourceVersion is an opaque observation or mutation precondition.

Only the host issues authority and row keys. A readable kube-system namespace UID supplies a nonauthoritative `kubernetes.namespace-uid.v1` hint with **connection-local** continuity on native resource Types and cluster-backed Helm releases. Local Helm repositories/charts have no cluster hint and remain isolated and unknown. Hints are Type-qualified, never catalog-wide; endpoints and credentials never establish backing identity.

Finite reads use native client-go operations and source-only continuation tokens. Enumeration keeps unknown totals unknown. The implementation-candidate `omniview.resource-wire-policy.v1` separates 16 MiB resource documents, 32 MiB aggregate frames, and at most 256 records from the host's smaller predicate/projection limits. Resource-only HTTP clients bound decompressed finite responses and each native watch frame before client-go materialization. Their actual SDK connection-generation context also cancels discovery APIs that internally use background contexts. Independent logs, exec, and metrics streams keep their native framing rather than receiving a finite aggregate body cap.

Resource tables, namespace selectors, repository chart drawers, and native dashboard adapters request `collection: true`. The runtime follows bounded source pages in the background and exposes the full acquired collection; source cursors are transport details, not UI navigation. Searches, filters, sorting, selections, and dashboard counts operate across that collection. Table selections use host record keys in one collection-wide selection state, reset when the target context changes. Unknown source totals remain unknown, and collection acquisition does not strengthen best-effort consistency.

Workload cards open the same canonical resource tables as the sidebar and search, preserving the selected connection. Metadata fields and collection health badges wrap independently on narrower views instead of overlapping. Dashboards and namespace selectors show no source-page controls.

Collection acquisition exposes loading and errors with an explicit retry action. Retry reacquires the failed catalog, target resolution, or collection stage. Changing target, scope, representation, route, plugin, or catalog identity must not mix records or selection from different target contexts.

Repository chart drawers resolve the selected native repository before background pagination through the chart Type's declared `repository` query dimension. Chart identity remains `helm:charts` with native opaque ID and only `domain=helm-client` identity scope; repository is not another identity field. Only configured repository bindings participate, and unrelated indexes are not loaded for a repository-scoped collection.

Valid empty `oneOf` selections for Helm release namespaces, repository domains, or chart repositories return an empty source page before any native or filesystem acquisition. Empty selections never become unscoped queries; pages retain explicit coverage and best-effort consistency without continuation.

Existing informer updates remain explicitly **bestEffort**. Cache readiness does not prove an atomic snapshot, replay, gap-free delivery, or P05 source continuity. Native `{namespace,GVR}` acquisitions are shared only while consumers remain; the final consumer stops the underlying LIST/WATCH and releases its cache. Connection teardown stops all remaining sources.

OpenAPI documents are bounded to 16 MiB and shared by document reference plus exact local root. Demand-driven catalog refresh runs at most once every 30 seconds per connected cluster, with a 10-second acquisition deadline. Each eligible refresh reacquires OpenAPI before comparing snapshots, so schema-only changes and recovery from an initial missing document can update the catalog. This is not a CRD watcher or immediate change notification.

One provider-wide 32 MiB retained-schema budget covers every connection, with a separate 16 MiB staging bound. Identical document bytes share retained storage. Exhausted entries are unavailable, not incorrectly absent, and resource Get remains independent. Replacement, failed acquisition, and teardown release the cache budget; queued acquisition is cancellable. Available, absent, and unavailable schemas remain distinct; raw OpenAPI transport does not claim P07 normalization or full validation. Editor metadata also forwards installed Helm chart `values.schema.json` roles with native acquisition errors intact. Creation can use a schema-derived template or a complete pasted native manifest.

Helm schema acquisition never grants or requires Helm Secret access for native Pod schemas. A source-specific Helm failure retains native bindings and returns a document-free, generic Helm values role marked unavailable with an optional safe machine-code `unavailableReason`, never backend diagnostics or invented release identities. Request cancellation, deadlines, and retired connection generations remain errors rather than partial success. All Helm metadata, storage, and schema HTTP requests reuse the existing authenticated bounded client.

Tables and navigation use canonical references, routes, target membership, and host keys. Raw tagged integer Values stay exact; display adapters narrow only safe integers to numbers and retain wide integers as `bigint`. Restart counts and image-byte totals preserve exact mixed integer arithmetic. Mutation and action requests retain known UID and revision guards. Native connection discovery, explicit overrides, and disabled routes remain separate; host persistence owns desired profiles, not provider-side kubeconfig edits. Specialized React Router routes retain decoded colons and protect native Type slashes as `%2F`.

Native and Helm resource sidebars and drawer factories register through `extensionRegistrations` at `omniview/resource/sidebar/infopanel` and `omniview/resource/drawer`. Exact `{pluginId, resourceKey}` metadata selects each opaque logical Type without parsing its spelling. Standard views and shared actions are identical for table and linked-resource drawers; the supported default drawer factory remains available for CRDs and other dynamically discovered resources without a dedicated sidebar.

Standard resource YAML drawers submit through the resource-v2 mutation hook using the original contextual route, reference, known incarnation, and observed revision. The editor requires catalog-advertised `mutationUpdate` support for the exact scope; the catalog's `update` capability describes advisory watch updates, not writes. Missing identity, unavailable catalog metadata, and non-mutating resources cannot submit. YAML integers retain their exact values through tagged Value conversion. Pending writes reject duplicate submits, parse and native failures retain the draft, and only a successful native mutation replaces the dirty baseline with the returned record. Target/reference changes retire the old editor state, so late results cannot overwrite another resource. Successful writes use the runtime's canonical resource-query invalidation.

Relationship resolution receives one canonical source Get and explicit host-admitted target bindings. Native links use the matching target Type, scope, route, and authority; source authority never substitutes for another Type. Missing or out-of-scope bindings fail explicitly, and overlapping bindings reject admission. Native acquisition failures remain errors rather than complete empty relationships. Resolvers follow observed references and native ownership, not an all-Type inventory scan.

Relationship declaration membership uses the complete route catalog, including Helm and audit types, rather than only discovered Kubernetes API bindings. Catalogued types without declarations return an empty declaration set; unknown types still fail with `NOT_FOUND`. Connection-generation leasing remains required for all metadata reads.

Native object-reference links use exact catalog bindings by observed API group and kind, never legacy GVK tokens or guessed plurals. Known core Pod endpoint references use `k8s:/pods` independently of OpenAPI availability, including the controller shape with omitted API version and known UID. Namespaces and known incarnations remain guarded; incomplete, ambiguous, or unavailable bindings stay explicitly unresolved.

Resource-scoped terminals, logs, metrics, and port forwarding carry original tagged Values plus actual canonical references and routes, never decoded display objects. Native selectors check supplied observations against the explicit matching route, provider, Type, scope, name, and known UID without acquiring another target Get permission. Neither body data nor a reference grants authorization. Pod and Node terminals retain native container/command behavior; PATCH-only node cordon/uncordon keep their native permissions and atomic UID guards. Native utility stream engines remain unchanged. Per-connection Prometheus overrides use string query parameters (`prometheus_service_name`, `prometheus_service_namespace`, `prometheus_service_port`), not fabricated observation fields. Ordinary cluster metrics omit resource intent.

The Kubernetes API, network, and certificate error classifier preserves native causes for local inspection but exposes only fixed, public-safe classification messages. Server messages, endpoints, network diagnostics, and certificate details stay in the wrapped cause, not this classifier's public error fields or serialized error text. The resource gRPC transport independently preserves its existing sanitization; asynchronous logs use a separate event path and are not covered by this classifier guarantee.

Metric queries and subscriptions use the SDK's sole connected-generation lease, never a stopped profile or first-connection fallback. Canonical connection retirement evicts native metric clients, detection results, proxy-failure state, and SPDY tunnels; pending work cannot publish into a later generation, and unrelated connections remain active. Helm configurations are operation-local rather than cached: HTTP-only Helm clients reuse the existing bounded TLS/exec/EKS transport, merging RPC cancellation with the source connection lifetime without mutating shared clients or reimplementing Helm storage.

The old mandatory CRUD/Find registration generator, public resource DTO stack, and duplicate `get_resource`, `list_resources`, `delete_resource`, `list_namespaces`, and `get_pod_logs` custom tools are retired. Kubernetes no longer registers a standalone tools capability or constructs a separate resource-tool client stack. The host generates MCP resource tools from the admitted route catalog, negotiates namespace values through scope discovery, and consumes bounded native log sessions through the existing resource controller. Shared native utilities remain available to their other consumers.

The replacement resource path retains native label selectors, every served API version, and the declared managed-field-free model projection without changing the UI default. Omitted list namespace selects the admitted all-namespace scope; namespaced Get/delete require a namespace and cannot widen configured restrictions. Native pages remain capped at 256 items while the host can collect up to 500 with truthful continuation metadata. Delete sends observed UID and resourceVersion preconditions. Finite pod logs default to 200 tail lines, clamp at 5,000, and cap output at 1 MiB; omitted container selection is delegated to Kubernetes, not promised to mean the first container. Logs do not add a hidden Pod Get requirement.

The owned kind/history audit fixture below is unchanged. Helm release enumeration is bounded through native Secret/ConfigMap storage; other Helm storage drivers are not advertised as bounded enumeration sources.

Node drain accepts `gracePeriodSeconds: -1` to leave Kubernetes eviction grace unset, preserving each pod's native termination grace period. The drawer sends that sentinel explicitly. Omitting the parameter retains the 30-second action default; zero requests immediate termination, nonnegative integers override the grace period, and all other negative values fail before cordon or eviction.
## Resource event and table performance

Informer updates with the same nonempty resource version and the same UID, name,
namespace, API version, and kind now stop before JSON encoding and watch delivery.
Changed or empty versions and identity replacements still emit updates. Initial
ADD replay remains intact.

Resource tables discover label and annotation columns from their existing
unfiltered resource result, without another resource subscription. Existing
per-resource storage keys remain shared across connections. New keys start
unselected; updates with no new keys preserve selection state and write nothing
to localStorage. Combined table columns retain their reference until inputs change.

Dashboard events now render a measured, overscanned viewport rather than mounting
every event. Filtering, search, warning counts, ordering, and object links still
cover the full event collection. The overview owns its Pod subscription and passes
its namespace-filtered result to the Pod summary card, avoiding duplicate live
event delivery and cache application. Initial List calls were already query-deduplicated.
Namespace scope changes reset the event viewport to its newest entries; live
updates preserve the current viewport. CI also runs age-clock tests explicitly
under `America/New_York` to enforce DST boundary coverage.

Age cells share one visibility-aware scheduler per renderer package. They preserve
second/minute/day formatting, stop while the document is hidden, refresh on resume,
and remove the final timer and visibility listener on unmount. Pod metrics acquire
only when CPU or memory columns are visible in a visible document. Persisted column
visibility applies before the observer mounts; pausing the observer does not
remount table rows or discard selection, filtering, focus, or scroll. Dashboard
metric consumers also pause while the document is hidden.
The single visible clock also checks wall-clock and time-zone changes once per
second, refreshing old labels after clock corrections without formatting them
on ordinary young-cell ticks.

Synthetic provider measurements for 300 representative pods: unchanged replay
0.054 ms, zero encoded bytes and allocations; changed updates 7.442 ms,
1,453,200 encoded bytes and approximately 6.63 MB allocations. These are different
workloads on the new handler, not a native before/after CPU comparison. Warm
informer List still serializes complete objects: 300 pods took 8.132 ms and
1,452,900 bytes; 3,000 took 75.024 ms and 14,529,000 bytes with fake clients.

These changes reduce provable event and storage work. They do not establish a
reduction in the reported 53.5% Graphics and Media / 35.6% WebContent CPU on a
300-pod connection. Native acceptance requires matched cluster, viewport, event
rate, warmup, and repeated dashboard/table/hidden-view captures.

Remaining work includes generalized single-owner ingestion, bounded transport,
projected resource representations, and source paging with complete query
membership and sorting. Event virtualization bounds mounted DOM, not event
acquisition, deduplication, or sorting. Do not truncate results or remove initial
ADD replay without proving List/watch handoff correctness. The
[performance tracker](https://github.com/omniviewdev/omniview/issues/212) links
agent-ready work, measured receipts, and SDK-v2 carry-forward requirements.
[FreeLens watch ownership](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens/blob/0c8f34ac6c5fe6546e25c7591abe335c8ca2b689/packages/core/src/renderer/kube-watch-api/kube-watch-api.ts#L107-L196)
and its [virtual list](https://github.com/freelensapp/freelens/blob/0c8f34ac6c5fe6546e25c7591abe335c8ca2b689/packages/core/src/renderer/components/virtual-list/virtual-list.tsx#L46-L123)
provide source references, not measured performance parity.

Regression checks:

```bash
cd ui
pnpm exec vitest run src/components/tables/ColumnFilter/useDynamicResourceColumns.test.tsx
pnpm exec vitest run src/utils/ageClock.test.tsx src/hooks/usePodMetricsBatch.test.tsx src/components/kubernetes/table/corev1/Pod/PodMetricsProvider.test.tsx
AGE_CLOCK_BENCH=1 pnpm exec vitest run src/components/kubernetes/table/shared/cells/AgeCell.benchmark.test.tsx --silent=false --reporter=verbose
cd ..
GOWORK=off GOFLAGS= go test ./pkg/plugin/resource/resourcers -count=1
GOWORK=off GOFLAGS= go test ./pkg/plugin/resource/resourcers -run '^$' -bench 'Benchmark(MakeEventHandler|Base_ListRepresentativePods)' -benchmem
```

The hook regression includes a zero-storage-write smoke check for unchanged keys
and empty results. Release 0.8.1 consumes the published runtime 0.9.1 reducer fix
through the `~0.9.1` dependency range and its matching pnpm lock entry.

The opt-in age benchmark mounts 300 and 3,000 real cells with controlled time;
its counters are not native CPU measurements. `AGE_CLOCK_BASELINE=1` requires
preserved pre-change cell source and asserts its old timer behavior, so it cannot
silently label the current implementation as the baseline. Storybook
`Dashboard/EventsTable` fixtures `Viewport300`, `Viewport3000`, and `Viewport30000`
exercise bounded mounting, final-item search, keyboard scrolling, varying row
heights, resizing, reordering, loading, and empty transitions.

## Connection route encoding

Cluster IDs are opaque values, including EKS ARNs containing `/`. Encode the ID with `encodeURIComponent` whenever constructing `/cluster/:id` links, including resource navigation, dashboard shortcuts, and connection settings. React Router returns decoded parameters; encode them again when constructing a new URL. Do not encode the entire path or decode an ID before inserting it into a path.

## Connection readiness

The resource route subtree uses the shared runtime `ConnectionBoundary`, so direct URLs, history, search, and sidebar navigation cannot mount resource hooks before the connection is ready. Navigation does not connect automatically: use **Connect and continue** to start the connection and resume the exact destination. Cluster selection and connection editing remain available offline.

Connection failures offer retry and credential-edit recovery. A disconnect removes protected resource content; watch progress and individual resource permission errors remain separate from connection readiness. The host protects detached resource drawers using the same runtime boundary.

The splash shows the saved cluster identity while checking, connecting, or recovering: avatar, provider, display name and description, context, auth-user name, kubeconfig path, and full connection ID. Display overrides are honored. Metadata loads independently without connecting; a missing or failed metadata read leaves the route ID and recovery controls visible. Credential contents and arbitrary metadata are not displayed. Successful connection replaces the splash with the requested resources.

Storybook's **Connections/ConnectionBoundary** stories provide mocked loading, disconnected, connecting, authorization, missing-connection, and error states, including metadata loading/failure. Interactive recovery opens a mocked Pod table instead of a redundant connected splash. The preview makes no backend connection requests.

Kubernetes plugin 0.9.0 requires Omniview 0.12.0 or later for resource-v2 integration and collection-wide tables and dashboards. Update the desktop app before updating the plugin. The historical 0.8.2 release requires its older compatible producer cohort and does not contain these changes.

## Local audit evidence fixture

`hack/history-audit.mjs` creates a separate, randomly named local kind sandbox.
It does not connect Omniview history, provide historical reads, or resolve the
blocked production query/evaluator gates.

Requirements: Node.js 26.13.0, `kubectl` compatible with Kubernetes 1.32, kind
**v0.27.0**, and a running local Docker engine using a Unix-socket Docker context.
Unset `DOCKER_HOST` and `DOCKER_CONTEXT`; remote Docker endpoints are refused.
Docker must permit bind mounts from the chosen directory. The node image is
`kindest/node:v1.32.2@sha256:f226345927d7e348497136874b6d207e0b32cc52154ad8323129352923a3142f`,
published for amd64 and arm64 in the
[kind v0.27.0 release](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/tag/v0.27.0).
Initial setup may download this image and kind's standard system images.
No fixture workload or external application image is needed.

Run from this repository. Choose an absolute, canonical path whose final directory
does **not** exist; do not use a symlinked parent (`/tmp` is symlinked on macOS).
For example, use a new directory below your real home directory:

```bash
SANDBOX="$HOME/omniview-history-audit-smoke"
node hack/history-audit.mjs create "$SANDBOX"
node hack/history-audit.mjs exercise "$SANDBOX"
node hack/history-audit.mjs inspect "$SANDBOX"
node hack/history-audit.mjs delete "$SANDBOX"
node --test hack/history-audit.test.mjs
```

Creation prints the generated name, private kubeconfig path, and explicit context.
Every cluster operation uses that kubeconfig/context, never the user's kubeconfig
or current cluster. Existing directories/clusters are never adopted. Ownership
checks require the exact kind label, sandbox host mount, and recorded container ID.
The private directory contains credentials: do not upload or commit it.

Exercise runs once per fresh sandbox. It performs ConfigMap create, patch, server
dry-run, RBAC-denied create, delete, and recreate, and asserts distinct incarnation
UIDs. It also creates a core Event, a namespaced custom resource with an explicit
CRD, and a status-subresource patch. Synthetic Secret and TokenReview probes check
the metadata-only boundary. CRD creation itself is metadata-only.

The mounted `audit/audit.jsonl` contains actual API-server audit events. The policy
captures RequestResponse only for fixture-namespace ConfigMap, Event, and Sample
writes. Secret, authentication, authorization, other namespaces, and other resources
remain metadata-only. `RequestReceived` is omitted. Inspect rejects malformed JSONL,
unexpected RequestReceived events, and bodies outside the allowlist; its evidence
lists audit IDs, stages, HTTP outcomes, request URIs (including dry-run), and UIDs.
Compare completed ConfigMap create UIDs with `exercise.json`; look for a 403 denied
request, a `dryRun=All` URI, and the Sample status patch. Synthetic unit-test audit
records are not real-cluster evidence.

Subprocess deadlines, output caps, and a 24 MiB inspection limit bound local work.
The audit log rotates at 20 MiB with one backup; inspect reads only the active file,
so run it promptly after exercise. This fixture does not prove durable retention,
watch ingestion, historical authorization, numeric query safety, or host history.
An interrupted create retains its sandbox and any partial cluster for explicit
cleanup. Run `delete` with the same directory; it refuses unknown/replaced containers
and retains evidence. A failure before a container exists leaves only local files.
After deletion, archive desired evidence, then remove the private directory yourself.

## Feature Overview

### Resource Management

Every resource type gets a dedicated, sortable table with:

- **Global search** across all visible columns
- **Namespace filtering** shared across resource views per connection
- **Column visibility** controls with persistent preferences
- **Resizable columns** with saved widths
- **Dynamic label/annotation columns** — promote any label or annotation to a first-class column
- **Inline create** — open a YAML editor pre-populated with a template for the resource kind
- **Row actions** — click any row to open a detail sidebar with tabs for overview, YAML, events, and more

### Scoped Command Search

Kubernetes plugin 0.9.0 requires Omniview 0.12.0 for collection-wide resource views, connection-route protection, live-Pod debug recovery, asynchronous resource actions, opening a connection in a new tab or window, and the shared search and resource-icon runtime contracts. Its standalone frontend pins published `@omniviewdev/runtime` 0.12.0, `@omniviewdev/vite-plugin` 0.11.0, `@omniviewdev/base-ui` 0.9.0, and `@omniviewdev/editors` 6.1.1 in `ui/package.json` and `ui/pnpm-lock.yaml`. Update Omniview before updating the Kubernetes plugin; the plugin's minor version is independent of the host version.

Cmd/Ctrl-K opens Omniview's single global search surface, including on Kubernetes pages. Type a connection name and press Tab to scope it, then scope a resource type and resource. Enter opens the selected destination or existing action. The sidebar's **Find in this connection** control opens that same surface with a visible connection chip.

Kubernetes routes automatically scope global search to the active connection only, including on Pod and other resource lists. Deeper scopes require explicit Tab selection or an explicit `openGlobalSearch` scope.

Empty-input Backspace selects the final chip; another Backspace removes it. Removing a parent also removes dependent scopes and restores the parent search. Resource results show namespaces and retain UID identity so replaced objects cannot inherit stale actions.

Search reuses the sidebar's destinations and eight connection-scoped recent resource types. **Open list matching …** transfers text into the resource table without changing its namespace, node/controller, or other structured filters. Search scans at most the first 200 objects and reports incomplete results; use the list for broader filtering.

Disconnected connections require explicit connection. Authentication, permission, loading, and source failures remain visible. Logs, container choices, and destructive-action confirmations use the same action inventory as resource menus and drawers, even when no table is mounted.

Resource scopes acquire native live-update subscriptions even when no table is open. Failed acquisition keeps current results visible and offers **Retry live updates**; closing or removing scopes releases their subscriptions. Event bursts preserve rows and selection, including updates received during an in-flight read.

Search and resource views share the runtime's `resourceQueryKeys` snapshots. Query refinements reuse resource data for 15 seconds and readiness for 2 seconds. Action execution still reads and validates the current object instead of trusting the discovery snapshot. A deleted or replaced object is an object failure, not a reconnect suggestion.

### Detail Sidebars

Click any resource row to open a rich sidebar panel with contextual information:

| Resource | Sidebar Highlights |
|---|---|
| **Pod** | Container statuses, ports, volumes, environment, probes, resource requests/limits, live metrics graphs |
| **Deployment / StatefulSet / DaemonSet** | Replica status, rollout progress, selector details |
| **Service** | Port mappings, endpoint resolution |
| **Ingress** | Rule table with host, path, and backend mapping |
| **Job / CronJob** | Completion status, schedule, parallelism |
| **Node** | System info, capacity, images, topology, conditions, live metrics |
| **Namespace** | Resource quotas, pod counts, events |
| **ConfigMap / Secret** | Key-value viewer |
| **PV / PVC** | Binding status, storage details, access modes |

All sidebars include a **YAML editor** tab with diff view and schema-validated editing.

### Integrated Terminal

Exec into any running container directly from the resource table. The plugin handles:

- Multi-container pods with container selection
- Intelligent shell detection (`bash` > `sh` > `ash`)
- Explicit distroless recovery with targeted ephemeral containers
- Node-level shell access via ephemeral debug pods
- Terminal resize support
- SPDY and WebSocket protocol fallback

### Live Pod Debug

Use **Debug** beside Exec and Logs in a Pod header. One running application
container opens a toolbox shell immediately; multiple containers show a
names-only target picker. No shell is required in the application image.
The command palette exposes the same **Debug: container** actions after scoping
to a Pod, including when its details drawer is closed.
Named targets remain pinned when other containers start or stop; a vanished
target never redirects the action to another container.

**Debug options** is secondary: choose a template or image, then expand
**Customize** only when needed. Its controls use `@omniviewdev/base-ui`.
Genuine missing-shell Exec errors offer **Debug this container**; other Exec
errors do not inject a debugger automatically. Node shell remains a separate
Node action.

The toolbox shares Pod networking and requests the selected container's process
namespace. Runtime support controls process visibility. Its root filesystem,
environment, user and trust store remain separate. `/proc/PID/root` inspection
also depends on permissions; the plugin does not automatically chroot, mount
credentials or elevate privileges.

The restricted default runs as UID 1000, drops all capabilities and disables
privilege escalation. Network-admin and privileged profiles require explicit
confirmation on every launch and remain subject to admission policy.
Required feature permissions are `get` on `pods`, `update` on
`pods/ephemeralcontainers`, and `get` plus `create` on `pods/attach` for the two
streaming transports.

Debug sessions retain their original Pod UID and exact container name.
Image failures show the actual waiting reason; inspect status before opening
a terminal. Reconnect attaches an existing running debugger rather than adding
another container. Completed entries cannot restart or reconnect. Closing a
terminal does not remove an ephemeral container, and Kubernetes does not allow
editing or deleting individual ephemeral entries. Correcting an image requires
an explicit new launch. An unconfirmed creation blocks duplicate submissions
until status can establish its outcome.

### Log Viewer

Stream container logs with full control:

- **Follow mode** for real-time tailing
- **Previous container** logs for crash debugging
- **Tail lines** and time-based filtering
- **Multi-container** log merging with timestamps
- Support for init, sidecar, and ephemeral containers

### Port Forwarding

Forward pod ports to your local machine:

- Configurable local and remote port mapping
- Active connection management
- Automatic cleanup on disconnect

### Helm Integration

Full Helm workflow without leaving Omniview:

- **Charts** — browse available charts from configured repositories
- **Releases** — view installed releases with status, chart version, and revision history
- **Repositories** — add, remove, and refresh chart repositories
- **Install** — install new releases with a YAML values editor and dry-run preview
- **Upgrade** — upgrade existing releases to new chart versions

### Cluster Dashboard

A dedicated dashboard view per cluster with:

- **Health banner** — at-a-glance cluster status
- **Resource gauges** — visual CPU, memory, and pod utilization
- **Workload summary** — running, pending, and failed pod counts
- **Live metrics** — CPU, memory, network, and disk usage over time (requires metrics-server or Prometheus)
- **Event feed** — real-time cluster events
- **CIS benchmarks** — security compliance scoring against CIS Kubernetes benchmarks

### Metrics

The plugin supports two metrics backends:

| Source | Data |
|---|---|
| **metrics-server** | Pod and node CPU/memory usage |
| **Prometheus** | Time-series metrics: CPU throttle rate, memory working set, network I/O, disk throughput, IOPS, filesystem usage, OOM kills, restart counts, probe latency, and more |

Metrics are displayed in the dashboard, node sidebars, and pod sidebars as interactive time-series graphs.

## Installation

Install directly from the Omniview plugin marketplace:

```
Omniview > Settings > Plugins > Browse > Kubernetes
```

Or install via the Omniview CLI:

```sh
omniview plugin install kubernetes
```

## Configuration

### Cluster Connections

The plugin automatically discovers clusters from your `~/.kube/config` file. You can also:

- Add clusters manually with custom kubeconfig paths
- Configure per-cluster display preferences (name, color, avatar)
- Set namespace restrictions per connection
- Configure node shell image and command overrides

### Debug templates and defaults

Open **Templates & defaults** from the Pod's secondary Debug options. Shell
(`busybox:1.37.0`) and Network toolbox (`nicolaka/netshoot:v0.14`) are immutable
starters: duplicate them to customize. Custom templates support a unique name,
image, JSON argv array, access profile, image pull policy and explicitly entered
non-secret environment values. Customize starts collapsed. Do not store secrets:
template values are ordinary plugin preferences, not a secret store.
Per-launch drafts reset when the Pod, target or resolved default changes.
Existing-volume mounts require canonical absolute paths; validation errors stay
beside the mount field before any creation request.

Templates and the all-cluster default persist in the plugin Data Store under
`debug_templates`. A cluster stores only its chosen template ID in its existing
connection-ID-keyed preferences (`cluster_overrides.debugDefaultTemplateId`).
The cluster choice wins over the all-cluster choice, then built-in Shell.
**Inherit all-cluster default** follows later parent changes rather than copying
the current image. Missing or invalid selections show an error and resolve to
restricted Shell.

**Save template** does not select a default or launch a container. **Save default**
persists the scope's selection separately. Cancel discards template drafts;
persistence errors remain visible without reporting success. Changes affect
future launches only. Pod identity, target container and volume bindings are
never template fields. An elevated saved template or default never authorizes
an elevated launch: each invocation still requires fresh confirmation and remains
subject to Kubernetes authorization and admission policy.

### Prometheus Integration

To enable advanced metrics, configure a Prometheus endpoint in the cluster settings. The plugin will query Prometheus for time-series data and display it alongside metrics-server data.

## Development

Resource-toolbar Create, search, filter and settings controls should consistently request `size="sm"` and rely on the shared density scale rather than fixed pixel heights. The host supplies shared `@omniviewdev/base-ui`, so shared styling fixes reach the plugin through the host's library release.

Resource tables set horizontal cell padding on the table root so header checkboxes, body checkboxes, and loading skeletons share the same inset. Keep the 30px row height and zero vertical cell padding scoped to the body; the header retains the shared library's height and interactions. The shared `@omniviewdev/base-ui` DataTable owns sticky selection and action column behavior.

### Invocation SDK contract

The backend consumes the published SDK pinned in `go.mod`. Restart streams emit `ready` only after the native patch succeeds and the rollout watch is established. Native failures return through the SDK classifier; unsupported stream actions return typed `UNSUPPORTED` errors. An open failure does not roll back a Kubernetes mutation already committed before watch establishment.

These action semantics require a compatible host/runtime cohort. Coordinate changes with [the host invocation contract](https://github.com/omniviewdev/omniview/issues/83); source integration does not publish a plugin release.

Resource watch streams acknowledge actual SDK listener registration before the host admits connections. Build the plugin and host from the same reviewed SDK cohort; the host rejects streams without that acknowledgement.

### Settings and shared dependency migration

Rebuild both the backend and UI when upgrading to this release. Older plugin
archives are not compatible with the host's current shared dependency contract:
the host shares React 19 and `@omniviewdev/base-ui`, not MUI, Emotion, or the
legacy `@omniviewdev/ui` package.

Settings validation uses the SDK's single structured
`Validator func(interface{}) settings.ValidationResult` callback. Kubernetes
currently registers no custom validators; host-managed settings use the SDK's
standard validation and draft-validation RPC. Do not add an error-returning
validator or a separate `ValidateValue` callback.

The plugin manifest schema has no minimum-host-version field. Keep the host,
backend SDK, runtime, and Vite plugin on the coordinated release cohort below
rather than adding unsupported manifest fields.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- Node.js 26.13.0
- pnpm 12.14.0 (pinned by `ui/package.json`)

Registry installs retain pnpm's 24-hour release-age protection. Only coordinated
`@omniviewdev/*` packages are exempted; linked source worktrees resolve locally.
The current UI cohort is `@omniviewdev/base-ui` 0.9.0 and
`@omniviewdev/editors` 6.1.1, paired with host/runtime 0.12.0, Vite plugin 0.11.0, and Go SDK v0.9.0.
Debug preferences discard unsaved drafts when reopened or switched to another
connection, but preserve active drafts when saved defaults refresh.

### Building

```sh
# Build the backend and UI (Make forces GOWORK=off)
make build

# Build the UI
cd ui && pnpm install && pnpm build
```

`make package` always builds into `ui/dist` before archiving its assets, even
when the environment contains a workspace-owned Vite output directory. Direct
workspace UI builds continue to honor `OMNIVIEW_BUILD_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`.

### Tests

```sh
GOWORK=off GOFLAGS= go test ./... -count=1
node --test hack/cluster-config.test.mjs
cd ui && pnpm test
```

UI persistence tests use the test document's real JSDOM storage, including on
Node versions that also expose process-global Web Storage.

### Frontend lint contract

ESLint 10 retains type-aware typescript-eslint checks through the JavaScript
TypeScript 6 API (`typescript` aliases `@typescript/typescript6`), while `tsc`
uses the native TypeScript 7 compiler. Do not suppress unsupported-version warnings.
React checks map explicitly to `@eslint-react`; import and accessibility checks
use `import-x` and `jsx-a11y-x`. Current React Hooks/compiler diagnostics cover
compiled sources without enabling a broader React preset.

React Compiler owns value and component memoization. The obsolete react-perf
allocation heuristic is not retained; it would recommend manual memoization and
legacy `sx` workarounds in compiler-optimized code. Correctness and compiler lints
remain enabled. The local nested-component adapter preserves `allowAsProps: true`
for table render callbacks; the JSX text check retains unescaped-entity diagnostics.
TypeScript handles duplicate/undefined JSX props, string refs, removed `isMounted`,
and invalid class render return types. Existing prop-types/display-name allowances
remain unchanged.

Run local rule regressions from the plugin root:

```sh
node --test ui/scripts/eslint/*.test.mjs
```


### Isolated workspace development

Select this plugin in an Omniview feature workspace and start its host with the
host-owned `omniview-dev workspace up` command. The workspace owns package/SDK
links, plugin generations, Vite ports and rebuilds. Use `workspace paths` for the
resolved state root; never infer it from a custom directory or copy production
plugin executables into it.

`make install` delegates the actual source transaction to the live host:

```sh
OMNIVIEW_WORKSPACE_FILE="$FEATURE/workspace.json" \
OMNIVIEW_STATE_DIR="$RESOLVED_STATE_ROOT" \
OMNIVIEW_DEV_CLI="$ABSOLUTE_OMNIVIEW_DEV_CLI" make install
```

All three values are required. No production fallback, direct state-tree copy,
independent build/install runner or `installui` shortcut remains. The canonical
host validates the selected source, builds with its verified SDK and returns the
operation result. UI edits use the managed Vite feedback loop.

Optional local tools need their own explicit assignments when used concurrently:

```sh
make storybook STORYBOOK_PORT=26061
make cluster CLUSTER_NAME=my-feature CLUSTER_HTTP_PORT=28080 \
  CLUSTER_HTTPS_PORT=28443 CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG="$FEATURE/.local/kubeconfig"
```

The kind ports bind loopback; the explicit kubeconfig avoids changing the human
current context. Existing clusters are checked against the requested ingress
ports before reuse; changing those ports requires deliberate deletion/recreation
or a different cluster name. `KIND_EXPERIMENTAL_PROVIDER` defaults to `docker`;
set it to `podman` or `nerdctl` to use the same provider for kind and port inspection.
Generated configurations are published atomically. Cluster creation/seeding is a
separate deliberate operation, not a workspace-start prerequisite or permission
to use a production cluster.

### Releasing

Commit matching versions in `plugin.yaml`, `plugin.json`, `.package/plugin.yaml`
and `ui/package.json` before creating a `vX.Y.Z` tag (or dispatching the release
workflow with `X.Y.Z`).
The release workflow checks those committed values; it never pushes version
changes back to `main`. The Go module and UI lockfile must resolve published
dependencies without a sibling checkout or workspace replacements. Local
`go.work` files are not release inputs: development SDK selection belongs to the
host's isolated workspace, and direct Go commands must use `GOWORK=off GOFLAGS=`.

The release workflow uses the Go version declared in `go.mod`, Node.js 26.13.0,
and native pnpm 12.14.0 to build five platform archives on a GitHub-hosted runner.
Marketplace publishing runs on the self-hosted `omniview` runners, which can
reach the API inside its cluster. Set `OMNIVIEW_API_URL` to the intended marketplace;
the publisher action's default is not a substitute for the configured target.
`OMNIVIEW_API_KEY` must authorize publisher `omniview` on that marketplace.
The publisher action submits the version for review; a successful workflow does
not establish marketplace approval. Confirm approval and installability in the
target registry before announcing availability. GitHub release notes are only
created after the build/submission job succeeds.
